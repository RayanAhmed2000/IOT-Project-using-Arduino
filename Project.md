# Objective 
To create a **Smart Device** (IOT Device) using **Arduino UNO R3** Microcontroller <br><br>
# Equipment Required
- Arduino UNO R3 Microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Mini Gear Servo Motor
- 9V Battery
- 9V Battery connector
- Connecting Jumper Wires <br><br>
# Theory
**Arduino UNO** is a microcontroller board, it is low cost and easily programmable microcontroller board that can be integrated in alot of Iot and electronic projects such as <br>
- Light on/off when TV is turned on
- Temperature Monitoring
- Obstacle detection
- Autoamted Plant watering system
- Simple Incubator <br>
and many more.....<br>
 
I have created a Smart IOT device which is based on **object detection** using an **Ultrasonic module**<br><br>

# Connections
## Ultrasonic module with Arduino R3
Vcc  -> 5V (for Power supply)<br>
Trig -> Pin 9<br>
Echo -> Pin 8<br>
Gnd  -> Gnd<br><br>
## Servo motor with Arduino R3
Red Wire    -> 3.3V (for power supply) <br>
Yellow wire -> Pin 7 <br>
Gnd         -> Gnd <br>
